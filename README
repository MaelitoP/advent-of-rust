This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2025, implemented in Rust.

The goal of this project is not only to solve the puzzles, but to learn Rust by doing: exploring ownership, iterators, pattern matching, error handling, and writing clear, testable code.

Each puzzle day is implemented as an independent binary (dayXX), while common utilities (input handling, parsing, grids, math helpers) live in a shared library.

Puzzle inputs are downloaded locally and intentionally excluded from version control, in accordance with Advent of Code guidelines.
